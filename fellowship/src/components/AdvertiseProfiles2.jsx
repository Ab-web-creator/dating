                  Almost as fresh as before, just in an older shell. Are you the one who has the potential to spend the rest of his life with me? 

                  I'm financially secure, goal-oriented and monogamous. I'm looking for a classic lifetime relationship, with someone who appreciates good conversation, shared interests. You don't have to be athletic or not. What really captivates me is your attentiveness and your extraordinary personality. Bonus points if you want to get married at some point.
