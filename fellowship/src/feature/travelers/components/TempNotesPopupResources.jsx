                    Currently, nothing is functional in this section. The book thumbnails below are for demonstration purposes only. However, in the near future, you will be able to: (a) read, (b) share links, and (c) publish articles.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Let us know how we can serve you better in this regard. The "publish" button above can open editorial page, so that the users with the role of "writer" could publish articles or small books.
                  </p>
                </div>
        </div>
